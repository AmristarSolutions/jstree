# jstree

[jsTree](http://www.jstree.com/) is vanilla JS lib, that provides interactive trees. It is absolutely free, [open source](https://github.com/vakata/jstree) and distributed under the MIT license.

jsTree is easily extendable, themable and configurable, it supports various data sources & data mappings as well as async loading.

**THIS IS V.4 - A WORK IN PROGRESS AND A COMPLETE REWRITE. CHANGES INCLUDE - NO MORE JQUERY, INFINITE SCROLLER RENDERER (SUPPORTING MILLIONS OF ROWS), SEPARATE DATA LAYER, AND MANY MORE.**

**A SIMPLE DEMO IS AVAILABLE IN DIST/INDEX.HTML, BUT TO EXPERIMENT WITH OTHER FEATURES - LOOK AT THE CODE. DOCS & TESTS ARE ON THE WAY. BASIC FUNCTIONALITY IS NEARLY COMPLETE. CURRENTLY THE DEMO WILL ONLY WORK IN BROWSERS THAT SUPPORT GENERATORS (NO IE FOR NOW, BUT WILL BE TRANSPILED LATER)**
